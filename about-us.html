In addition to that, we also use the traditional fired-clay ovens which give our products a unique taste which we all remember from our childhood. And only by respecting the knowledge and experience of the former generations can we make bread that would make our ancestors proud.</div>

In a specially arranged small bakery we knead and bake samples of bread and pastry in order to improve some of the existing products or to develop completely new ones. This is how we came to produce our unique and innovative products such as whole grain delicacy bread, bacon rolls, hot sandwiches...</div>
